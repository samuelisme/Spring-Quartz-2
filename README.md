Spring-Quartz-2
===============
This a simple Java program to demostrate how to use trigger listener in Spring. When I implement TriggerListener, 
I tried to put most of the logic in Application context (quartz-context.xml), so I used Reflection, then we can configurate 
a list of tasks in XML, avoid writing Java codes. Enjoy!
